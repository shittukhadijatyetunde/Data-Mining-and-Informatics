Another way is to use the \"describe\" function which can be used to identify wrong data in numerical variables, or value counts for categorical variables.\n"

    "Overall, encoding is important in many aspects of data processing, storage, and transmission in Python and other programming languages. It allows data to be represented, manipulated, and communicated effectively in a variety of contexts and environments.\n",

    "QUESTION A\n",
    "The income column has four variable type (<=50, >=50k. <=50k.,>=50k) this are four different variables in data ,upon encoding all variables ranges between 0,1,2,and 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "QUESTION B\n",
    "Education is an Ordinal variable as it can be ranked in order of hierarchy, all variables were encoded accordingly\n",
    "\n",
    "QUESTION C \n",
    "We had numerous nomial column in the dataset, i chose race as their is an adsence level of rank to ethnicity,The code's output demonstrates how the 'race' column was transformed into a one-hot encoded representation, with additional binary features representing each race category.\n",
    "\n",
    "QUESTION D\n",
    "After running the code, the output will show the first few rows of the dataframe, with the race column encoded with one-hot encoding.One-hot encoding is a technique for converting categorical variables into numerical representations for machine learning algorithms.It generates binary columns for each category in the original categorical variable, with one indicating the category's presence and zero indicating its absence.using \"concat\" funtion we append the column race Each distinct category in the 'race' column has been transformed into a binary column (also known as a dummy variable) prefixed by 'ethnicity_,Each row in the dataframe now includes binary indicators for the individual's ethnicity, allowing for further analysis or modelling tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "QUESTION E\n",
    "Normalisation scales numerical features to a similar range, preventing larger magnitudes from dominating the learning algorithm. This ensures that all features make an equal contribution to the analysis or model training process.In the dataset out numerical columns are 'age', 'fnlwgt','education-num','capital-gain','capital-loss','hours-per-week', and has been normalized into similar numerical grouping for better machine learning understanding and scaling."
